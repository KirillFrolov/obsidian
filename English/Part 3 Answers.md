**What is the difference between films and books?**

I would say the biggest difference between films and books is that they are completely different mediums. This basically means the experience you have with either books or films will be entirely different. The whole process is kind of different. One of the defining features of a good book is that it tries to create a mental image while you're reading. The author wants you to imagine things that aren't really there. Films, on the other hand, provide the images for you, so you’re interpreting the meaning behind the visuals.

**Do you prefer books or movies?**

Personally, I’m more of a movie guy. Honestly, I don't actually enjoy either that much because both take up too much time. Nowadays, people are really into short content, like one-minute videos. I think today's equivalent of a book is a 10-15 minute video, compared to a feature-length film that lasts an hour and a half. Our attention spans have shortened, and I don't really have that much time, since I'm always working and focusing on new projects. I can't spend all my time reading books or watching movies.

**Is it important to read a book before watching the movie version of it?**
 
That's a really interesting question. I guess it depends on the series and what the purpose of the adaptation is. Some die-hard book fans will tell you that you *must* read the book first, but I don't think it's always necessary. Movies can’t be a verbatim copy of the book because books are usually more vivid. The images you create in your head while reading are often more creative than what can be done with a movie’s budget. So, no, I don't think it's always necessary to read the book before watching the movie, but it can add to your experience and give you a deeper insight into the original thoughts of the writer.

**How can reading help children?**

I’d say the best thing children can get from books is the ability to imagine things beyond their immediate surroundings. For example, if they have a bike, they might imagine riding it really fast. If their dad has a car, they might imagine driving it one day. But when children read books, they can imagine much deeper things and explore thoughts in all sorts of directions. This helps them think more deeply and develop better thought patterns. Although I’m not a psychologist, I’m 100% sure that books are one of the most beneficial things for a child’s intellectual development.
 

**Do you think parents should help their children develop a reading habit from an early age?**

I think they definitely should. I tell my students that reading is like a muscle—it’s a habit. Unlike other skills, you can’t learn it in one day. It takes time, and you need to do it regularly over a long period to see improvement. That improvement will be gradual, but it will happen. Helping a child develop a reading habit is one of the most powerful things a parent can do. It gives their child a huge advantage in life. A person who reads regularly develops patience and perseverance, qualities that will serve them well in life. If I have kids, I’ll prioritize getting them to enjoy reading, even if it means watching movie adaptations or doing extra activities to make it fun.

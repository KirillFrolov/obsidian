That's a really interesting question. I guess it depends on the series and what the purpose of the adaptation is. Some [[die-hard]] book fans will tell you that you *must* read the book first, but I don't think it's always necessary. Movies can’t be a [[verbatim]] copy of the book because books are usually more [[vivid]]. The images you create in your head while reading are often more creative than what can be done with a movie’s budget. So, no, I don't think it's always necessary to read the book before watching the movie, but it can add to your experience and give you a deeper insight into the original thoughts of the writer.

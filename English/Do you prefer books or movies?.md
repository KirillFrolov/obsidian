Personally, Iâ€™m more of a movie guy. Honestly, I don't actually enjoy either that much because both take up too much time. Nowadays, people are really into short content, like one-minute videos. I think today's equivalent of a book is a 10-15 minute video, compared to a feature-length film that lasts an hour and a half. Our attention spans have shortened, and I don't really have that much time, since I'm always working and focusing on new projects. I can't spend all my time reading books or watching movies.

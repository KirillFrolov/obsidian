Five month ago, you started renting an apartment on a six-month agreement. You now wish to stay in the apartment for longer than the six months you originally agreed with the owner.

Write a letter to the owner of your apartment. In your letter

- say how long you now want to rent the apartment for
- explain why your plans have changed
- tell the owner about a problem in the apartment

Dear Mr. Anderson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss my rental [[arrangement]] at 78 Brown street , which I began leasing approximately five month ago on six mont agreement. I have greatly enjoyed living here, and the apartment has proven to be an ideal home for me.



Our rent agreement lasts in one week and I would like to extend it for a long time. 

I

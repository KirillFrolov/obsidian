Five month ago, you started renting an apartment on a six-month agreement. You now wish to stay in the apartment for longer than the six months you originally agreed with the owner.

Write a letter to the owner of your apartment. In your letter

- say how long you now want to rent the apartment for
- explain why your plans have changed
- tell the owner about a problem in the apartment

Dear Mr. Anderson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss my rental [[arrangement]] at 78 Brown street 6b, which I began leasing approximately five month ago on six month agreement. I have greatly enjoyed living here, and the apartment has proven to be an ideal home for me.

As the end of our agreement [[approaches]], I would like to express my interest in extending my lease beyond the original six-month term.  I would be grateful to continue living in apartment  for an additional 6 month.

Since moving into the apartment, changes in my personal and professional plans have made it more practical for me to stay here for a long time. Given how comfortable and well-suited the apartment  has been for my needs, I feel that extending my lease would be the best option.

Additionally, I would like to mention about a small problem I faced in the apartment. The heating system regulator is not working properly. It is not a critical issue but I would appreciate it if we could arrange for someone to assess and repair this issue at a convenient time.

Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Kirill Frolov






Our rent agreement lasts in one week and I would like to extend it for a long time.

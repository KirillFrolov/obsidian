Yes, I believe parents should set goals for their children, but with some important [[considerations]]. Setting goals can provide children with a sense of direction and help them understand the value of hard work and perseverance. For example, if a parent encourages a child to aim for a particular level in a sport or to improve their academic performance, it can motivate the child to develop discipline and responsibility.  

However, it’s crucial that these goals are realistic and aligned with the child’s interests and capabilities. Goals that are too [[rigid]] or focused [[solely]] on the parents’ [[aspirations]] can lead to unnecessary pressure and may even [[discourage]] children if they feel they cannot meet those expectations. Instead, parents should involve children in the goal-setting process, listening to their interests and helping them set objectives that are both challenging and achievable.

Moreover, the purpose of setting goals should be to foster  growth and confidence in children rather than simply measuring success by achievements. When children feel supported and empowered in their pursuits, they’re more likely to develop a positive mindset and resilience that will benefit them in the long run. Therefore, while goal-setting by parents can be valuable, it should always prioritize the child’s well-being and personal growth.

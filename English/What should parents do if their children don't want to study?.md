If children don’t want to study, I think parents should first try to understand the reasons behind this [[reluctance]]. Children may resist studying for various reasons: they might find the subject too challenging, lack interest, or even feel overwhelmed by pressure. Instead of forcing them, parents should have an open conversation to explore these underlying issues. By understanding the root cause, parents can take a more supportive approach, which is likely to be more effective.  

Additionally, parents could try to make studying more engaging and relevant to the child’s interests. For instance, if a child enjoys a particular hobby, parents could show how certain subjects connect to that interest, making learning more enjoyable and meaningful. Sometimes, using creative learning techniques, such as games, videos, or interactive exercises, can also increase a child’s motivation.

Finally, it’s important for parents to model a positive [[attitude]] toward learning. When children see their parents engaging in reading, exploring new ideas, or discussing interesting topics, they’re more likely to view studying as a valuable and lifelong activity. Ultimately, by providing support, encouragement, and a balanced approach, parents can help their children develop a more positive [[outlook]] toward studying and education in general.

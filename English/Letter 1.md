- explain why it should be included in the event


Dear Mr. Luis,

I hope you are doing well.

As a member of the international student club, I would like to make some suggestions about the dishes that I could offer for a festive culinary event.

I would love to contribute to the event by sharing one of my favorite traditional dishes from my country: pancakes. They are simple to make, requiring only a few basic ingredients, yet they are incredibly delicious and sure to be a crowd-pleaser.

To provide a bit more context, pancakes are one of the most popular dishes in my nation. There are many different recipes for making it, but the simplest one contains only a few ingredients: flour, eggs, milk, salt, and sugar. Despite their simplicity, they are incredibly versatile and can be served a variety of topping such as jam, chocolate cream, or even just butter.

This dish represents warmth and hospitality, which aligns perfectly with the spirit of the event. Given its cultural significance and appeal to a wide range of tastes, I believe pancakes would be an excellent addition to the event's menu.

I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,

Kirill Frolov

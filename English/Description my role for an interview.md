In my current role, I work with a company that develops a specialized construction planning solution designed to integrate [[seamlessly]] as a plugin within a common data environment (CDE). Our solution focuses on enabling detailed planning for construction documentation and project timelines in direct association with BIM models. This means that project teams can create and manage their schedules in alignment with 3D models, which supports a more coordinated approach.

  One of the key aspects of the solution is its ability to visualize the construction process directly on the BIM model. This feature allows users to identify and highlight areas where schedule [[deviations]] or issues are occurring, which helps the team address potential delays early. Additionally, the solution supports labor resource planning by connecting [[workforce]] requirements to specific tasks, and it also includes functionality for tracking time worked. Overall, this tool provides a comprehensive, integrated approach to managing construction schedules and resources within a common data environment.

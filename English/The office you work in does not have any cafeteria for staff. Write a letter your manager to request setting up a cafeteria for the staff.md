- what you heard about the inconvenience from the staff
- how you feel about it
- what suggestions you have about setting up a cafeteria

Dear Tom,

I am writing to bring to your attention a concern raised by many staff members regarding the lack of a cafeteria in our office.

Several colleagues have mentioned the inconvenience of having to leave the office for meals or rely on delivery services. This often leads to delays and even reduced productivity.

Personally, I feel that having a cafeteria would greatly improve the overall work environment. A defined space for  meals would not only save time but also provide an opportunity for staff to unwind. It is important for employees to have convenient and comfortable place to eat and recharge during their breaks,

I would like to suggest considering an in-house cafeteria with basic amenities such as microwave and refrigerator. Partnering with local vendors to provide daily meal options could also be a coast-effective and practical solution.

I believe this change would benefit both the staff and the company by promoting well-being and efficiency. Thank you for considering this proposal. I am happy to discuss further if needed.

Best regards, 
Kirill Frolov

**Dear Mr. Smith,**

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding the recent changes to the bus schedule in our area.

Since the new timetable was implemented, it has become difficult for many residents to commute to work on time, as the buses are either delayed or overcrowded. This issue has particularly affected those who rely on public transportation during peak hours.

I would appreciate it if you could review the new schedule and consider reinstating the previous one or introducing additional services to alleviate the congestion.

I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

**Dear Mrs. Green,**

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you about a small maintenance issue I have encountered in the apartment.

Recently, I noticed that the kitchen faucet has started leaking, which is causing some water damage to the countertop. I believe the issue may be due to worn-out washers in the faucet.

Could you kindly arrange for a plumber to fix this at your earliest convenience? Please let me know if you would like me to provide further details or contact the plumber myself.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

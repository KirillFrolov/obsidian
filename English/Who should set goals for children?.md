In my view, setting goals for children should be a collaborative process involving both parents and the children themselves. When parents set goals alone, they may [[overlook]] the child’s personal interests and unique abilities, which can lead to frustration and disengagement. However, when children are given some say in setting their goals, they’re more likely to feel motivated and take ownership of their achievements.

For example, a parent might encourage a child to aim for better grades in a subject, but the child might have a passion for sports or music. By including the child in the discussion, they can find a balance, perhaps setting goals in both academics and an area the child enjoys. This approach helps children learn to set realistic and meaningful goals, which is a skill that will serve them well throughout their lives.

That said, teachers can also play a valuable role in setting goals, especially academic ones. Teachers have insight into a child’s strengths and areas for improvement in a learning context, and they can guide children in setting realistic academic goals. In summary, a balanced approach involving parents, teachers, and the children themselves is ideal for setting goals that are both achievable and personally rewarding.

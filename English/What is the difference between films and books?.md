I would say the biggest difference between films and books is that they are completely different mediums. This basically means the experience you have with either books or films will be entirely different. The whole process is kind of different. One of the defining features of a good book is that it tries to create a mental image while you're reading. The author wants you to imagine things that aren't really there. Films, on the other hand, provide the images for you, so youâ€™re interpreting the meaning behind the visuals.

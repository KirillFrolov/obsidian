Hi Tom,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you because I'm currently looking for someone who could go football match this weekend instead of me and I think you will be interested.

The match is part of FIFA World Cup and will take a place at Central stadium. It's going to be an exciting game between Spain and Italy.  Both teams are grate in this season, and the atmosphere at the stadium is sure be electric. 

However,  I've had a change of plans and can no linger  attend because important work obligation. It's disappointing, but I didn't want the ticket to go to waste, so I thought of you.

The ticket is an e-ticket and I can email to you. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll make sure to get it to you in time for the match.

I really hope you can make it and enjoy the game on my behalf! Let me know soon.

Best wishes,
Kirill

Write a letter to the local authority

In your letter, you should tell:

• explain how you knew about the plans

• describe the negative effect of the construction on your neighbourhood

• suggest a possible solution to the problem.


Dear sir or madam,

I am writing to express my concerns regarding the recent plans to construct an airport in our locality.

I found out of this development through a public notice in the official website of local council, which outlined the proposed location and timeline for the project.

While I understand the importance of infrastructure development, I am concerned about the significant negative impact the project could have on our neighbourhood.

No, I don’t agree that a high salary is the only reason why people choose [[certain]] jobs. While salary is certainly a significant factor — especially in terms of financial security and lifestyle — it’s not always the [[sole]] motivation. Many people are [[drawn]] to jobs that [[align]] with their personal interests, values, or long-term career goals. For instance, some people might prioritize a sense of purpose or social impact over a large paycheck, choosing roles in education, healthcare, or social services even though these sectors may not always offer the highest salaries.
  
Additionally, work-life balance is another key reason why people might choose a particular job. With growing awareness of mental health and well-being, many now seek roles that offer flexible hours, remote options, or more manageable workloads, even if it means sacrificing higher pay. A supportive workplace culture, opportunities for personal growth, and job stability are other factors that can be equally or more attractive than just a high salary.

Ultimately, while a high salary can be enticing, many people also consider non-monetary factors that contribute to their overall job satisfaction. Thus, it’s often a combination of salary and these other aspects that influence their career choices.

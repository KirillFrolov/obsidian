I’d say the best thing children can get from books is the ability to imagine things beyond their immediate surroundings. For example, if they have a bike, they might imagine riding it really fast. If their dad has a car, they might imagine driving it one day. But when children read books, they can imagine much deeper things and explore thoughts in all sorts of directions. This helps them think more deeply and develop better thought patterns. Although I’m not a psychologist, I’m 100% sure that books are one of the most beneficial things for a child’s intellectual development.

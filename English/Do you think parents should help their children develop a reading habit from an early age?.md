I think they definitely should. I tell my students that reading is like a muscle—it’s a habit. Unlike other skills, you can’t learn it in one day. It takes time, and you need to do it regularly over a long period to see [[improvement]]. That improvement will be [[gradual]], but it will happen. Helping a child develop a reading habit is one of the most powerful things a parent can do. It gives their child a huge advantage in life. A person who reads regularly develops patience and perseverance, qualities that will serve them well in life. If I have kids, I’ll prioritize getting them to enjoy reading, even if it means watching movie adaptations or doing extra activities to make it fun.
